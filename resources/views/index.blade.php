                    A migraine is a headache that ranges from moderate to severe with the pain being felt as throbbing. Migraines are usually felt on one side of the head and usually last from a few hours to 3 days. Migraines either come with a warning sign, no warning signs or even a warning sign with no headache. Warning signs, often called aura, vary from visual problems to numbness in the arm. Often there are other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting or even sweating.<br/><br/>
